# DyKnow Blocker (for Mac)
## How it works
Renames the DyKnow file and kills the process

## Install
You need an application that can compile and run Java code (I use BlueJ, it's what the school equipped me with)
Create a new project in your application
Paste the Java code into application
Compile
Drag all of the contents into /Applications/.cloud
Run from there

## Instructions for dummies
### Where is the .cloud folder?
To view the .cloud folder, hit `command + shift + .` to view hidden folders
### Where do I put the code??
- To get the code into BlueJ, click on "New Class", name it anything, then just paste the code over whatever is there by default.
- Press Compile
- Right click on the square
- Click on void main(String[] args)
- Press OK
