# DyKnow Blocker (for Mac)
## How it works
Renames the DyKnow file and kills the process

Can be toggled ON/OFF for your convenience

## Install
You need an application that can compile and run Java code (I use BlueJ, it's what the school equipped me with)

Create a new project in your application

Paste the GodButton.java Java code into application

Compile

Drag all of the contents into /Applications/.cloud

Run from there

## Instructions for dummies
### Where is the .cloud folder?
To view the .cloud folder, hit `command + shift + .` to view hidden folders
### Where do I put the code??
I made it a bit easier for BlueJ users
- EASY WAY:
    - Download the folder, drag the CONTENTS of the folder into /Applications/.cloud
- MANUAL WAY:
    - To get the code into BlueJ, click on "New Class", name it anything, then just paste the code over whatever is there by default.
    - Press Compile
    - Right click on the square
    - Click on void main(String[] args)
    - Press OK
